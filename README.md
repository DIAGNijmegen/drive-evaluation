# Evaluation for a Type 2 challenge with DRIVE

The source code for the evaluation container for a type 2 challenge with the DRIVE dataset, generated with evalutils version 0.3.1.

Note: For Type 2 challenges, grand-challenge.org creates a `predictions.json` file which will indicate how the output filenames are mapped to the input filenames. `./jsonloader.py` indicates how the mapping can be retrieved to produce the correct evaluation metrics.
